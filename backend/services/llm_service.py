"""
LLM Service for Jarvis Personal Voicebot Memory Assistant.

This service provides natural language understanding capabilities using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
It processes user voice inputs by classifying text type, summarizing content, and extracting
structured metadata. These functions enable Jarvis to intelligently organize spoken ideas,
tasks, and reminders before saving them to Notion or the memory database.

Part of the Jarvis "Brain Extension" system that captures voice inputs and automatically
organizes them into structured formats. This LLM service powers the intelligence layer
that transforms raw transcribed speech into categorized, tagged content ready for storage
in Notion databases or ChromaDB for persistent memory and easy retrieval.
